Welcome to my webpage!

This is my first webpage using HTML.

This code creates a basic webpage with a title, header, and paragraph. HTML is the standard markup language used to create webpages and is essential for creating any website.

 This HTML code creates the basic structure of the Connectify website, including a header with a navigation menu, a main section with a feed of posts and a sidebar with news and suggested friends, and a footer with copyright information.

 Of course, this is just the beginning of creating a full-fledged social media website like Connectify. We would need to use other programming languages like CSS and JavaScript to style the website and add interactivity, as well as server-side languages like PHP or Python to handle user authentication, database management, and other backend functionality.
