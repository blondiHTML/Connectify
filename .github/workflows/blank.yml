  Certainly, here is an example of how to use the computer code Magic-text code app cloud-App dark-magic:
  
  ```html
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  Welcome to the Magic Text Code App!
  
  
  
  Enter your text below:
  
  
  
  Make it magical!
  
  
  Your magical text:
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  ```
  
  This code creates a simple web page with a text area and a button. When the button is clicked, the text in the input area is passed through two functions: `magicTextCode` and `darkMagic`. The `magicTextCode` function converts the text into a special code that can be interpreted by the `darkMagic` function. The `darkMagic` function then performs some kind of magical transformation on the text and returns the result, which is displayed in a div element with the id "output".
